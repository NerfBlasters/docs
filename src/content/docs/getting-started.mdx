# Getting Started with Orbit

## Prerequisites

Orbit requires Ansible and Terraform for automation and infrastructure management. Here's how to install them:

### macOS

```bash
# Install Homebrew if you haven't already
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install Ansible and Terraform
brew install ansible
brew install terraform
```

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
# Install Ansible
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y ansible

# Install Terraform
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common
wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform
```

### Linux (RHEL/CentOS)

```bash
# Install Ansible
sudo dnf install -y ansible

# Install Terraform
sudo yum install -y yum-utils
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/RHEL/hashicorp.repo
sudo yum -y install terraform
```

## Quick Installation

### macOS and Linux

```bash
# Download the Orbit executable
wget https://github.com/orbitscanner/orbit/releases/latest/download/orbit

# Make it executable
chmod +x orbit

# Set your API key (must be 32 characters)
export ORBIT_API_KEY=12345678901234567890123456789012

# Start Orbit
./orbit serve

# Access the web interface at
http://localhost:8090
```

### Windows Support

:::caution[Windows Limitations]
Windows is not natively supported due to dependencies on Ansible and Terraform. These tools are designed for Unix-like systems and have limited Windows support. We recommend using one of these alternatives:
- Docker installation (recommended for Windows users)
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) with Ubuntu
- Running in a Linux virtual machine

If using WSL2, you can follow the Ubuntu installation instructions above within your WSL2 environment.

## Docker Installation

Docker provides the easiest way to run Orbit across all platforms.

```bash
# Pull the Orbit image
docker pull orbitscanner/orbit:latest

# Run Orbit container
docker run -d \
  -p 8090:8090 \
  -e ORBIT_API_KEY=12345678901234567890123456789012 \
  orbitscanner/orbit:latest

# Access the web interface at
http://localhost:8090
```

### Docker Compose

For a more complete setup, you can use Docker Compose:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  orbit:
    image: orbitscanner/orbit:latest
    ports:
      - "8090:8090"
    environment:
      - ORBIT_API_KEY=12345678901234567890123456789012
    volumes:
      - orbit_data:/data
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  orbit_data:
```

Run with:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
